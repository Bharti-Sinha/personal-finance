This project aims to build a query workflow to streamline my monthly financial review.

💼 This solution will have several features such as: managing multiple sources of income, planning for different types of savings, and tracking and reporting insights from expenditures across categories (groceries, travel, dining out etc.). Also, I'll be adding features as I identify them while developing. 

👀 Towards this aim, the notebook starts with loading documents to a vector database, creating indexes for vector search and summarization, query tools and router implementation using LLMSingleSelector. 

🗒 The documents, for now, are limited to our incomes, expenses and savings. (The data is randomly generated). 

✅ To be able to query the CSV files I implemented a basic Agentic RAG - a Router, which can dynamically interpret user queries. This allows users to perform basic queries such as “How much did we spend on groceries in April?”, “How much do we have left from our incomes after all the expenses in May”.

⏳ Follow along on my profile! I'm building this project and will be adding new features as I progress. Stay tuned to see what I develop next.
